# ‘scipen’: integer. A penalty to be applied when deciding to print numeric values in fixed or exponential notation.  Positive values bias towards fixed and negative towards scientific notation: fixed notation will be preferred unless it is more than ‘scipen’ digits wider.
# use scipen=999 to prevent scientific notation at all times

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
trade <- data.frame(read.csv("trade_jan_18_2021.csv"))
#rename columns
names(trade)[2] <- "username"
names(trade)[4] <- "villager.traded.away"
names(trade)[5] <- "NMT"
names(trade)[6] <- "bells"
names(trade)[7] <- "villager.received"
names(trade)[8] <- "items.services.received"
```

villager.trade; those who traded for a villager only answered none; No NMT traded marked as zero; should be excluded. No bells traded marked as zero- should be excluded.

```{r}
# data clean
as.double(trade$NMT)
as.double(trade$bells)
```


```{r}
#most traded villagers, stats
top_10 <- trade %>%
  group_by(villager.traded.away) %>%
  summarize(Freq = n(), Average_NMT = mean(NMT), Average_bells = mean(bells)) %>%
  arrange(desc(Freq)) %>%
  filter(villager.traded.away != "NONE")

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
